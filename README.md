## Wim Hof Breathing Session Web App

Click [here](https://danieldreke.github.io/wim-hof-breathing-session/) to start an interactive breathing session guided by Wim Hof.

### Motivation

The official youtube video [Guided Wim Hof Method Breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) has beautiful background music but being a video it has certain disadvantages:
- The retention times are fixed.
- No autopause before breathing in.
- Youtube's interface is clumsy for pausing/resuming.
- Limited to three rounds.

Thus I created this interactive web app to be able to be guided by the official Wim Hof video with its beautiful background music but with a simple interface and added features.

### Features

- Check `Autopause` before starting a session for autopausing the video for longer retention times.
- Click `Start Breathing In` to skip remaining retention time to immediately breath fully in.
- Do additional rounds by clicking `One More Round` or `Two More Rounds` after the end of round three.

### Notes

- This is **not** an official app of Wim Hof.
- Above linked website is an installable [progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application).
- It behaves similar to a native smartphone app once installed/added to your home screen.
- Your mobile browser should show `Add to your home screen` after some seconds.
  - It can also be installed manually.
- This github repository is the backend of this installable web app.
